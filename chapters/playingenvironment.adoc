=== Field Setup
==== Dimensions
The field of play must be rectangular and of the following size:

* Division A: 13.4 meters times 10.4 meters with a playing area of 12 meters times 9 meters
* Division B: 10.4 meters times 7.4 meters with a playing area of 9 meters times 6 meters

The exact field dimensions and the field markings at the venue may vary by up to Â±10% in each linear dimension.

The two figures below show the dimensions of the field, the goals and special field areas, measured in millimeters. Figure 1 shows the dimensions for division A and figure 2 for division B.

==== Field Surface
The playing surface is green felt mat or carpet. The floor under the carpet is level, flat, and hard.

The field surface will continue for 0.7 meters beyond the <<Field Lines, field lines>> on all sides. The outer 0.4 meters of this runoff area, separated from the robot area by a 0.1 meters tall wall, is used as a designated walking area for the <<Referee, referee>> and the <<Assistant Referee, assistant referee>>.


==== Field Markings
The field of play is marked with lines. All lines are 0.01 meters wide and white (paint, spray, white carpet or strong tape). Lines belong to the areas of which they are boundaries.

===== Field Lines
The playing area is defined by four field lines. The two longer field lines are called touch lines. The two shorter field lines are called goal lines.

===== Additional Lines
The field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line that runs along the width of the field and through the center of the field.

A mid-line runs along the length of the field, passing through the center of the field. This line is used to provide adequate features for the geometry calibration of the <<Vision, vision software>>.

===== Center Circle
The center mark is indicated at the midpoint of the halfway line. A circle with a diameter of 1 meter is marked around it for both divisions.

===== Defense Area
A defense area is defined at each end of the field as a rectangle of 2.4 meters times 1.2 meters for division A and 2 meters times 1 meter for division B.

===== Penalty Mark
For each field half the penalty mark is 1.2 meters for division A and 1 meter for division B, from the midpoint between the goalposts and equidistant to them, thus coinciding with the outer edge of the defense area.

==== Goals
Goals must be placed on the center of each goal line and anchored securely to the field surface. They consist of two 0.16 meters high vertical side walls joined at the back by a 0.16 meters high vertical rear wall. The inner face of the goal has to be covered with an energy absorbing material such as foam to help absorb ball impacts and lessen the speed of deflections. The goal walls, edges, and tops are white in color.

The distance between the side walls is 1.2 meters for division A and 1 meter for division B, and the goal is 0.18 meters deep. The goal walls are 0.02 meters thick and touch the goal line, but do not overlap or encroach on the field lines or the field. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show these details for division A and division B respectively.
