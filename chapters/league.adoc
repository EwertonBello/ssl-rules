== League Overview

=== Divisions
The Small Size League is divided into two divisions with separate tournaments, namely division A and division B. Division A is aimed at advanced teams whereas new and/or less competitive teams can play in division B. Each team will only play in one of those two divisions.

When submitting the <<Qualification, qualification>> material, the team also chooses a preferred division including a short rationale. The members of the organizing committee will have the final word.
